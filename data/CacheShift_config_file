Brown is 100% failure. White is no transfer (thus no problems). If you see a noticeable degradation of quality of transfers from all sites, it's most likely a GridKa problem, but Phedex problem is not excluded. Cross checks in Phedex logs are necessary. Report to CMS expert on call (see <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/T1GridKaShifterPage">Shifter Page</a>) and fill in the Shifter's wiki. In your report include the time problem started (judged from the plot), and why do you think there is a problem.

http://www.gridka.de/monitoring/rrd/png/dcache_tapeio_day_cms.png	GridKa dCache CMS tape I/O Rate (1day)	If write rate in the recent hours is below the rate of CMS transfers to GridKa in Prod instance of Phedex, then tape migration is not keeping up. If the rate is 0 and there are successful transfers to GridKa in Prod instance, then tape migration stopped. Cross check with dCache tape-write buffer plot (is it filling up?) and report to GridKa and CMS expert on call. If the rate to tape is near 0 and transfers to GridKa are also failing, check the dCache tape-write pools. If dCache tape-write pools are full - report to GridKa.
